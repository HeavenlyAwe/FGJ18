The game in this repository is a slightly improved version of the original game jam submission. 
This version loads and runs better than the jam submission and includes some more assets that were cut from the 
jam submission due to time constraints. 

The refactoring and code improved have mainly been done by Jeremias, Christodder and Adelina.
